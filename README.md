In the online lecture we covered two design patterns, singleton and factory and how to implement them in unity(code) and unreal(blue print) as well as the basic uml and main differences between each. Singleton is when you create a class that will only have one instance of it at all times, which in context of video games could be a state manager. Factory design pattern is when you create a class with the purpose of creating objects of another class. (like an enemy spawner)
